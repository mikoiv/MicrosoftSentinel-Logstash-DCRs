## Fortigate CEF integration to Microsoft Sentinel with Logstash

Tested on FortiOS v7.2.x.

Utilizes Logstash to forward CEF messages to Sentinel, via Data Collection Rule. 

Remember to review both the **Logstash filter** and the **DCR TransformKQL** to understand how this filters and maps the logs. Make changes according to your own needs.
